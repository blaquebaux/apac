# Blaque Baux APAC

**Asia-Pacific.**

APAC is a member of the Blaque Baux family. The [core repo](https://github.com/Carter-Warrens/blaquebaux)
is the **engine and blueprint** — a governed, systematic platform (Julia) with a venue-agnostic
execution controller and a Layer-3 live-money safety gate. APAC points that engine in its own
direction and inherits the governance wholesale.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Carter-Warrens/blaquebaux-apac.git
julia --project=engine -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'   # one-time engine setup
```

## The thesis

Regional exposure (EWJ, EWY, EWT, FXI/ASHR, EWA, INDA and peers). The base's Blunt #3 already found the Asia-to-US 'cascade' is priced instantly (no next-day edge), so APAC's edge, if any, is regional rotation and trend, not lead-lag into the US.

## Research plan (Path A — not yet built)

- Regional trend / rotation across APAC country ETFs.
- Semis linkage — Taiwan/Korea vs the global chip cycle (cf. Blunt #3, the correlation study).
- Cross-region rotation with EMEA and LATAM.

Nothing above is implemented or validated. This is the map, not the territory.

## Status
**Scaffold.** Engine wired as a submodule; strategy research not yet conducted.

## The Blaque Baux family
Base: **Blaque Baux** (engine + spine). Sleeves: **Blunt** (short-horizon tactical) · **Boom** (mega-cap blue chips) · **Brash** (crypto/alternatives) · **Bleed** (tail-catcher) · **Bottom** (penny/micro-cap) · **Brittle** (near-expiry OTM options) · **Broad** (broad/thematic ETFs) · **Bore** (market-neutral) · **Bulk** (defense) · **Brown** (conservative sectors) · **Blue** (entertainment/green-energy/tech) · **Beyond** (short-horizon growth) · **Bubble** (the AI complex) · **Basel** (Basel-regulated banks) · **Bio** (biotech / idiosyncratic) · **Bounce** (range-bound 'kangaroo' market) · **EMEA** (Europe/Middle East/Africa) · **APAC** *(this repo)* · **LATAM** (Latin America) · **BitDollar** (crypto / dollar axis) · **Blurred** (uncorrelated basket) · **Backsliders** (broken decliners (short)) · **Brute Force** (artificially propped-up) · **Block** (derivative-strategy basket).
